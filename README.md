# League Of Legends Champion Information
Champion info for league of legends account based on summoner name. 

Work in progress! 
## Features: 
- Pulls information from official League of Legends API for total champions 
- Pulls information for total number of champions without a chest obtained 


## Future additions: 
- Data visuals 
  - pie chart for no chest champions
  - bar graph for overall champion mastery 

## What I learned: 
- Chaining promises and returning responses to new promises with "then"
- Not easy to make data visuals in EJS and Node :( 
 

### Technologies used: 
- League of Legends API 
- Express.js  
- Node.js 
- EJS 
- SemanticUI
